		This is gonna be a bit long, I'll put a TLDR at the end.

Back in elementary school, I played what is now Old School RuneScape. I didn't enjoy the PvP so much as the grind to get higher stats than my friends and be able to get my mining and woodcutting so high that I could make some sick cash off of the people that hated doing exactly that. When I got membership, I fell in love with construction and crafting. I loved making my house cooler and making all these neat little things to sell off for high prices. I liked the money.

Hit high school and I stopped playing RS pretty much completely. I picked up a new game: Aion. It was cool, I liked it, then I hit level 15. Free house. Instantly I looked to being able to make it cooler, and what do you know? Construction skill, not locked behind a pay wall. While I wouldn't mind paying for access to more of the game, I was happy to see it free, and I liked the model it had. Raising second life stats in that game was a bit less intuitive. You kind of just had a lot of materials on you then said how many times you wanted to attempt to make one thing, so you basically just bought enough to make 100 of your highest thing then go watch YouTube till it was done.

		Square Enix’s Marvel’s Avengers game should’ve been the biggest slam dunk in the world. After years of teasing that gave Final Fantasy VII remake a run for its vaporware money, the AAA superhero blockbuster made its big debut at E3 2019. But instead of benefiting from the outpouring of Marvel love following Avengers: Endgame, everyone was mostly creeped out by the off-brand actors.

However, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 on Nintendo Switch, a game that was only announced a few months ago and is still coming out sooner, seems poised to swoop in as the Marvel universe video game you should actually care about. And while my recent hands-on session didn’t convince me the game would be a classic, at least it looks like a cool comic book game and not a bootleg MCU movie.

While the title suggests this will be a follow-up to the original Marvel Ultimate Alliance game by Raven (which itself continued the legacy of the X-Men Legends games from the same developer) Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order is now developed by Team Ninja. And at first that sounds weird. But when you look at this frenetic beat ‘em up of colorful recognizable heroes plowing through faceless goons with huge superpowered attacks, you realize this is just another Dynasty Warriors reskin like Hyrule Warriors or Fire Emblem Warriors just with more Western appeal.
